## Git helper

If you need some help with git, follow this procedure.

```
1. clone your forked repo
Command : `git clone REPOSITORY_NAME`
2. then setup the original repository that you forked from as upstream
Command: `git remote add upstream UPSTREAM_REPOSITORY_NAME`

3. Each time you start coding make a fetch request to download the latest codes from original repo and be updated
Command: 
`git fetch upstream`
`git pull upstream master`

Now you're all set.

To push your own codes follow these steps:
1. `git add .`
2. `git commit -m "commit name"`
3. `git push -u origin REPOSITORY_BRANCH_NAME`

Then go to your repo and make a pull request.

## Naming conventions

### Naming folders

Folder structure should be organized in such a way that we understand any file's location on context.
The folder name should be minuscule only and written with a single word.

To help new contributors, it is advised to have a clear separation of the parts of the application.

#### Examples

Say we are looking for the *Cart component*.
Since this is a component, it has to be in the `/component` folder.

```
components/
  accounts/
    Login.vue
    Register.vue
  administration/
  cart/
    Cart.vue
    OrderSummary.vue
    MiniCart.vue
  products/
    Products.vue
    Filters.vue
    single/
      ProductInfo.vue
      ProductDescription.vue
```
